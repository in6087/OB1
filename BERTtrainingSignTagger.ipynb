      "5482 Oh my dear paws !\n",
      "5483 Oh my fur and whiskers !\n",
      "5484 She 'll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets !\n",
      "5485 Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ?\n",
      "5486 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves ,and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them ,but they were nowhere to be seenâ€”everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool ,and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .\n",
      "5487 Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !\n",
      "5488 I think I could , if I only know how to begin .\n",

      "5491 Who ever saw one that size ?\n",
      "5492 Why , it fills the whole window !\n",
      "5493 But I 'm NOT a serpent , I tell you !\n",
      "5494 said Alice .\n",
      "5495 While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down ,and the poor little thing howled so ,that Alice could hardly hear the words : â€” The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather .\n",

      "5511 You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , &quot; added the Gryphon ;and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice ,who felt ready to sink into the earth .\n",
      "5512 On her first full day with the group , she said a colleague asked her questions about her sex life in front of male officers .\n",
      "5513 As soon as the first part was ended Mr . Fitzpatrick and Mr . Holohan went over to Mrs . Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that , in case her daughter did not play for the second part , the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing .\n",
      "5514 And there was a great deal more in that than you would think .\n",

      "5526 He was so different when he took any drink .\n",
      "5527 But everything 's curious today .\n",
      "5528 Down , down , down .\n",
      "5529 And the Elephant 's Child 's nose kept on stretching ;and the Elephant 's Child spread all his little four legs and pulled ,and pulled ,and pulled ,and his nose kept on stretching ;and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar ,and he pulled ,and pulled ,and pulled ,and at each pull the Elephant 's Child 's nose grew longer and longerâ€”and it hurt him hijjus !\n",

      "5535 What a curious plan !\n",
      "5536 exclaimed Alice .\n",
      "5537 The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks .\n",
      "5538 The Mock Turtle sighed deeply ,and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this : â€” &quot; I 'm a poor man , &quot; the Hatter went on , &quot; and most things twinkled after thatâ€”only the March Hare saidâ€” &quot; It is one of the mysteries of behind-the-scenes acoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be heard all over the house ,while the stage-manager can burst himself without annoying the audience .\n",

      "5547 Very , &quot; said Tegumai ; ' but it has ruined all my fishing for the day .\n",
      "5548 I only wish it was , &quot; the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .\n",
      "5549 This of course , Alice could not stand ,and she went round the court and got behind him ,and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away .\n",
      "5550 I may be wrong ,but I should have thought that friendship , true friendship , was quite free from selfishness of any kind .\n",

      "5560 Then came a peasant woman down the street crying : ' Good jams , cheap !\n",
      "5561 Good jams , cheap !\n",
      "5562 This rang pleasantly in the tailor 's ears ; he stretched his delicate head out of the window ,and called : ' Come up here , dear woman ; here you will get rid of your goods .\n",
      "5563 If a crowd collected in the street he always added himself to it ,and he would have stopped to gape at a window with ' Watch this window &quot; written on it , if he had been running for his life from wild bulls .\n",
      "5564 There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house ,and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep ,and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it ,and talking over its head .\n",
      "5565 The Duchess took her choice ,and was gone in a moment .\n",
      "5566 I 've a right to think , &quot; said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to feel a little worried .\n",
      "5567 Oh , I am so sorry , &quot; said Hans , ` but I am really very busy to-day .\n",

      "5571 Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it , for I am going back to Court almost immediately .\n",
      "5572 You are making my spots ache , &quot; said Painted Jaguar ; ' and besides , I did n't want your advice at all .\n",
      "5573 Why , SHE , &quot; said the Gryphon .\n",
      "5574 Why ca n't you be like the Happy Prince ?\n",
      "5575 asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon .\n",
      "5576 Now I go in for domesticity ,and look after my family .\n",
      "5577 She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .\n",
      "5578 Soup does very well withoutâ€” Maybe it 's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered , &quot; she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , &quot; and vinegar that makes them sourâ€”and camomile that makes them bitterâ€”andâ€”and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered .\n",
      "5579 She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ' ORANGE MARMALADE ' ,but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .\n",
      "5580 While the group of thugs surrounded Sarah Field 's estate car at a music festival , Roger Gedge crawled underneath .\n",
      "5581 Then the Elephant 's Child sat down most hard and sudden ;but first he was careful to say ' Thank you ' to the Bi- Coloured- Python- Rock- Snake ;and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose ,and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves ,and hung it in the great grey-green , greasy Limpopo to cool .\n",
      "5582 Then he saw his children , quite little , as they : were at that time : one with a little cloak on , another at his mother 's breast .\n",

      "5584 They went on together ,and as they passed a cherry-tree , the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging , bent it down , gave it into the tailor 's hand ,and bade him eat .\n",
      "5585 Are n't you well ,or are you ill , O Tribe of Tegumai ?\n",
      "5586 That I ca n't remember , &quot; said the Hatter .\n",
      "5587 When the doctor 's four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment , they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air-pump or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope ,or some similiar nonsense , with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates .\n",

      "5591 I thought there was going to be lots of screaming and shouting all the way through but there was n't .\n",
      "5592 Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing ,and went to sleep ; the jack stopped ,and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king 's dinner stood still ;and the cook ,who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss , let him go ,and both fell asleep ; the butler ,who was slyly tasting the ale , fell asleep with the jug at his lips :and thus everything stood still ,and slept soundly .\n",
